# Who's on first

> This contraption is like something out of a sketch comedy routine, which might be funny if it wasn't connected to a bomb. Iâ€™ll keep this brief, as words only complicate matters.

## Rules
1. Read the display and use step 1 to determine which button label to read.
2. Using this button label, use step 2 determine which button to push.
3. Repeat until the module has been disarmed.


__Step 1__

Based on the display, read the label of a particular button and proceed to step 2.
